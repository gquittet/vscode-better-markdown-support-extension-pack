# Better Markdown Extension Pack

VSCode has a great support for markdown. But it can be better.
To fix this, I made this extension pack that add improvements to VSCode like:

- Math support
- Linting
- TOC generation
- etc

## List of extensions built-in

- DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint
- goessner.mdmath
- yzhang.markdown-all-in-one

**Enjoy!**
